  |   Shakedown: Hawaii follows three protagonists through a 16-bit open    |
  |   world. Build your own "legitimate" corporation by completing          |
  |   missions, acquiring businesses, sabotaging competitors, "re-zoning"   |
  |   land, and shaking down shops for protection money.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Explore the island by foot, by car, or by boat. It's filled with      |
  |   arcade challenges, sidequests, stores to shop at, houses to burgle,   |
  |   civilians to interact with, and secrets to discover.                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You begin your adventure as an aging CEO, struggling to make sense    |
  |   of the modern world. Online shopping killed his retail stores, ride   |
  |   sharing his taxi business, and streaming his video stores. To save    |
  |   the company, he'll need to learn the "methods" of modern business,    |
  |   and use them to rebuild his empire.                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The entire island is up for grabs... or at least, could be with the   |
  |   right business model.                                                 |

  |   It's business in the front, and bodies in the back... in Shakedown:   |

  |   "The Mogul Update".                                                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As well as addressing the usual bugs, it seems that several of the    |
  |   coming tweaks and features are designed to remove much of the         |
  |   laborious work involved in taking over and controlling an entire      |
  |   island, leaving you to enjoy the fun parts and streamlining the       |
  |   monotonous aspects of criminal empire building.                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Completing 'shakedowns' in the game allows you to earn extra cash     |
  |   outside the main story missions, but these were designed to be        |
  |   played in conjunction with the story. According to developer Brian    |
  |   Provinciano, many players concentrated on the shakedowns and          |
  |   therefore struggled to make progress buying up the island. Extra      |
  |   'dialogue and guidance' has been added to make sure the player        |
  |   understands better that the main missions net you the big bucks.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   There are plenty more additions, too. Check out the following list:   |
  |                                                                         |

  |   - Car Repossession (earn extra cash for your Subprime Auto            |

  |                                                                         |
